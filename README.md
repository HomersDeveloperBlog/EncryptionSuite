# EncryptionSuite
An implementation of the popular public key encryption scheme, RSA (and more!), gratuitously applied as a block cipher for file encryption.

It's hard to underestimate how much longer this took than I was hoping for. I was expecting 40 hours worth of work. Not even close.

It's about 85% done. The backend (RSA algorithm) is 100% done. All the pieces of the frontend need to be tied together, and the OO structure needs a bit of an overhaul. Its not currently in a stable form; it doesn't even compile. I had to upload it so a few people could see it.
